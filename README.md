# vRP Bank Cards

## Description
 With this script you can use a debit card (which is an item) to make purchases or pay people. It's even possible to steal another player's card and use it to make buy something on your own, even if the owner is offline. To avoid fraudolent use of the cards you have to approve every transaction with your very own PIN that you can change in the menu. Criminals can also get a bruteforcing machine, that will enable them to gather the code for any card they stole, so be very careful!

 By default there is a blip at the Pacific Standard Bank where players can get a card contract, but it's even possible to set up the bank as a [business](), then you can roleplay as a bank teller and issue players their card, or even deposit and withdraw cash for them! The script is also complete with a transaction tracking feature, that you can use wherever you want to track where and how everyone spends their money!

 There is even a POS terminal at every vRP market and at every [player owned business](), so the card will be usable everywhere!

  function vRP.tryFullPayment(user_id,amount)
      local money = vRP.getMoney(user_id)
      if money >= amount then -- enough, simple payment
          return vRP.tryPayment(user_id, amount)
      else  -- not enough, withdraw -> payment
          if vRP.tryWithdraw(user_id, amount-money) then -- withdraw to complete amount
          return vRP.tryPayment(user_id, amount)
          else
          local cardbal = vRPca.getCoins({user_id})
          local bankbal = vRP.getBankMoney(user_id)
          totale = money + cardbal + bankbal
          prelevare = amount - money - bankbal
          if totale >= amount then
              if vRPca.tryCoinPayment({user_id,prelevare}) then
              vRP.giveMoney(user_id,prelevare)
              vRP.tryWithdraw(user_id, bankbal)
              return vRP.tryPayment(user_id, amount)
